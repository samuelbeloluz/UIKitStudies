Constraints

When building a screen, we can mark where the constraint will be based, and to do this just click on the down arrow to display the available options when placing the constraint value.
To duplicate a certain amount of elements on the screen, we select them by holding 'shift' and clicking and dragging while holding 'Option', we make the duplication.

Remember: BackSpace is delete on Mac.

Linked Constraints: We can make other elements have their Constraints based on just one element, for this we click on the element that we will copy the Constraints, holding cntrl, and drag the arrow to the element that will inherit the Constraints, and then it will open the screen to select which Constraints we want. We can hold 'shift' while selecting the Constraint, to select more than one and the panel does not close.
In case when you finish the process and the element remains the same size and with the orange color, it is because it is out of the correct proportion that is supposed to be equal to the cloned element. To solve this go to the bottom of the page where the Constraints field is located, in the first element on the left that is a circle with an arrow, when clicking it adjusts all elements with Constraints out of correct proportion on screen.
Building the screen in this way helps in maintaining and adjusting elements on screen, it is very interesting to think this way when you are going to build screens.

Note: In Xcode's iPhone emulator, when typing in a TextField with isSecureTextEntry = true, a bug may occur where the text box is all covered by 'Strong password', this happens in the emulator but not on the device. To disable this in the emulator, go to settings on iphone, go to passwords and disable show compromised passwords.

Command + k - enables and disables virtual keyboard when filling out a TextField.

Usually when we were going to give some property to an element, we use UI and property, as in example: UIColor, UIKeyboardType, since this comes from UIKit, which is framework that we use for development.
